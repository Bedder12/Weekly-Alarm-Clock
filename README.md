# Weekly-Alarm-Clock
My goal is to develop a graphical application (GUI) for a weekly alarm clock. In this project, I’ll apply basic principles to build a robust and well-structured piece of software. During this exercise, I’ll focus on creating a user-friendly interface with different components while managing the logic behind the weekly alarm clock based on my requirements.

These requirements include allowing the user to set the day, hour, minute, and second separately using buttons or similar controls. The clock will run continuously, and the user will be able to switch between digital and analog time displays. Additionally, it will be possible to view all the alarms that have been set and remove them all with a single button press. The GUI will also show when an alarm goes off.

By combining the interface with the necessary functionality, I aim to create an intuitive and efficient weekly alarm clock.
